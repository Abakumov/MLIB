Fixed a number of bugs (e.g. a bug in "write_segy_file" that showed up under Linux).

Added an option to "s_wplot" that plots seismic sample values as spikes (for reflection coefficients - see help example).

Simplified parameter input: Keywords can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique; for example, in "s_wplot", {'annotation','cdp'} is the same as {'an','cdp'}.
   
More scripts with examples and a work flow, WF_Seislab_examples, which runs all examples - one after the other.

Updated and expanded the manual with descriptions of the I/O functions, the plotting capabilities, and a few specific functions that needed more of an explanation.
